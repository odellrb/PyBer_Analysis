# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. PyBer operates in three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. We compared each city's metrics and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. For this challenge, we took it a little further and made a summary of the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

## Results
In this data frame below we can see that there is a trend between how populated a city is and the total number of rides, which directly affects the total number of drivers, total fare, and both averages. Although the total number of rides, drivers and fares decrease as the cities become farther from urbanized areas, the average fare per ride and per driver seems to increase. This can be explained by the accessibility of PyBer rides and drivers in rural areas. Less drivers in rural areas will lead to a higher average fare per ride and driver, as prices increase.

With the multiple-line chart, we are able to compare total fares by city type over a period of five months. The number of rides seem peak at the end of February and fluctuates during the month of March.

## Summary
Out of the one hundred tewnty cities the average fare per ride shows a gradual increase from more populated cites to less populated cities. However, the average fare per drive increases drastically when following the same trend. If the company tried to hire more drivers in rural areas this may help increase their profits over time.
